# iOS-Easy-Task
Using the latest version of Xcode, create an app that has one button. When the button is pressed, the current temperature in Houston Texas is shown in a text field. By current temperature, we mean the temperature when we run your app.

# Your comments or assumptions
- <add them here>

Met problems when writing tests, create another swift file called weather.swift, aiming to initialize temperature and test it when URL link is invalid (expected: throw errors)

Will not affect the overall performance as Houston Texas (city ID: 4699066) is given to us by OpenWeatherApp API
